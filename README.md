# fathom-sim-queue-flow

`fathom-sim-queue-flow` is a C# project for Simulations. It turns create a C# reference implementation for queue workflows, centered on graph analysis, node-edge fixtures, and cycle and reachability reports into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Fathom Sim Queue Flow

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## What It Does

- Models input state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep policy checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for fixture data, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents local reports tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Design Sketch

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The C# code keeps the core model in a small static API and runs checks through the executable path.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Setup

The only required setup is the local C# toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Fixture Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Limits

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Next Directions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more simulations fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
